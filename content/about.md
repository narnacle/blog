I’m Nándor Ras, philosopher and hypocrite by inclination, temperament, and habit. I think in long sentences and act in short ones, usually contradicting myself somewhere in between. I believe deeply in principles—especially flexible ones. If certainty is a vice, I practice it briefly before abandoning it for doubt, which I then defend with unnecessary confidence.

I want your cake. I also want to eat it. After that, I would like to discuss, at length, why the cake didn’t live up to expectations and how this is somehow your fault. This is not malice; it’s method. I test ideas the way some people test desserts: aggressively, repeatedly, and with a critic’s palate that only emerges after consumption.

I’m interested in ethics, responsibility, and the convenient ways we misplace both. I admire honesty but prefer irony, value truth but reserve the right to reframe it, and distrust purity in all its forms—especially my own. If you’re looking for consistency, you won’t find it here. If you’re looking for reflection, contradiction, and the uneasy feeling that you might be complicit in all of this, then we’re already thinking together.

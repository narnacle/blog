When you see messages like:

```
warning: in the working copy of 'public/index.html', CRLF will be replaced by LF the next time Git touches it
```

it means Git has detected files with CRLF (Windows‚Äëstyle) line endings and plans to normalize them to LF (Unix‚Äëstyle) when committing. This happens because you set:

```
git config --global core.autocrlf true
```

That setting makes Git convert CRLF ‚Üí LF when staging/committing, and LF ‚Üí CRLF when checking out on Windows ([Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73184797/what-does-it-mean-lf-will-be-replaced-by-crlf-the-next-time-git-touches-it?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What does it mean LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time git touches ..."), [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/66838?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How can I stop this error.

### üö¶ Why the warning appears

- You currently have files with **LF endings** in your working directory.
    
- With `core.autocrlf=true`, Git will convert those LF ‚Üí CRLF on **checkout** in future ‚Äî hence the warning about LF being replaced by CRLF next time Git touches it ([Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17628305/windows-git-warning-lf-will-be-replaced-by-crlf-is-that-warning-tail-backwar?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Windows git \"warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF\", is that warning ..."), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30523236/lf-will-be-replaced-by-crlf-in-git-the-file-will-have-its-original-line-endings?utm_source=chatgpt.com "gitlab - LF will be replaced by CRLF in git -the file will have its ...")).

### ‚úÖ How to address it

#### 1. **Choose a line‚Äëending strategy**

Depending on your needs:

|Setting|Behavior|When to use|
|---|---|---|
|`true`|CRLF in working copy, LF in repo|Windows‚Äëonly projects|
|`input`|No conversion on checkout, CRLF ‚Üí LF on commit|Cross‚Äëplatform projects|
|`false`|No automatic conversion|If you or your team enforce LF/CRLF manually or via `.gitattributes`|

To switch strategies, run:

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf input
```

or

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

([Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43023096/working-on-windows-but-getting-lf-will-be-replaced-by-crlf-when-committing-in?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Working on Windows, but getting \"LF will be replaced by CRLF\" when ..."), [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/66838?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How can I stop this error. LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time ..."), [vcloud-lab.com](https://vcloud-lab.com/entries/devops/resolved-git-warning-lf-will-be-replaced-by-crlf-in-file?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Resolved: Git warning LF will be replaced by CRLF in file"), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30523236/lf-will-be-replaced-by-crlf-in-git-the-file-will-have-its-original-line-endings?utm_source=chatgpt.com "gitlab - LF will be replaced by CRLF in git -the file will have its ..."))

#### 2. **Suppress the warnings**

If you like your existing conversion behavior but find the messages distracting, turn off Git‚Äôs safe‚Äëcheck:

```bash
git config --global core.safecrlf false
```

This disables warnings related to irreversible line-ending fixes ([Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73184797/what-does-it-mean-lf-will-be-replaced-by-crlf-the-next-time-git-touches-it?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What does it mean LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time git touches ..."), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7893599/how-to-turn-off-git-warnings-lf-will-be-replaced-by-crlf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How to turn off Git warnings \"LF will be replaced by CRLF\"?")).

#### 3. **Normalize existing repository**

To ensure consistent line endings across your repo, follow these steps:

1. Update your `core.autocrlf` setting (e.g. to `input` or `false`).
    
2. Rename‚ÄîGit will re-scan line endings:
    
    ```bash
    git add --renormalize .
    ```
    
3. Commit the changes:
    
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Normalize all line endings"
    ```
    
4. Optionally push and verify that future clones respect your setting ([GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/66838?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How can I stop this error. LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time ..."), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63429518/git-still-shows-lf-will-be-replaced-by-crlf-warning-when-autocrlf-is-false-and?utm_source=chatgpt.com "windows - Git still shows ‚ÄúLF will be replaced by CRLF‚Äù warning when ..."), [shkodenko.com](https://www.shkodenko.com/how-to-fix-lf-will-be-replaced-by-crlf-the-next-time-git-touches-it-on-windows/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How to fix LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches it on ...")).

### üßæ Summary

- You're seeing Git normalizing line endings in files under `public/` and warning you because of `core.autocrlf=true`.
    
- Choose a configuration that fits your project:
    
    - `true` for Windows, `input` or `false` for cross-platform consistency.
        
- Use `.gitattributes` for fine-grained control if needed.
    
- Optionally disable warnings via `core.safecrlf=false`.

Here‚Äôs a solid `.gitattributes` setup to normalize line endings for your Hugo project reliably‚Äîregardless of your collaborators‚Äô OS or Git settings:

---

## üß∞ Recommended `.gitattributes` File

```text
# Auto-detect text files and normalize to LF in the repository
* text=auto eol=lf

# Force shell scripts to use Unix (LF) line endings
*.sh     text eol=lf

# Force Windows batch scripts to use CRLF
*.bat    text eol=crlf
*.cmd    text eol=crlf

# Treat binary files as binary (prevent modification or diff noise)
*.png    binary
*.jpg    binary
*.gz     binary
*.zip    binary
```

- `* text=auto eol=lf` ensures Git detects text files, stores them in the repo with LF endings, and checks them out as LF even on Windows ([simonprydden.github.io](https://simonprydden.github.io/git-repo/gitattributes?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Git Attributes File | Data Handbook")).
    
- The `.sh` and `.bat/.cmd` overrides guarantee correct line endings for scripts on their intended platforms ([Muhammad Rehan Saeed](https://rehansaeed.com/gitattributes-best-practices/?utm_source=chatgpt.com ".gitattributes Best Practices - Muhammad Rehan Saeed"), [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Git - gitattributes Documentation")).
    
- Marking binaries prevents Git from touching them or running diffs on line endings ([GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics/configuring-git-to-handle-line-endings?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Configuring Git to handle line endings - GitHub Docs")).
    

---

## üîß Applying and Enforcing the New Settings

Once you commit the `.gitattributes`:

1. **Commit any uncommitted changes** to avoid losing work.
    
2. Refresh the entire repository to apply these rules:
    
    ```bash
    git add --renormalize .
    git commit -m "Normalize line endings via .gitattributes"
    ```
    
    This ensures all text files now use LF in the repo‚Äîconverting any that were CRLF‚Äîwithout adding untracked files ([Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7156694/git-how-to-renormalize-line-endings-in-all-files-in-all-revisions?utm_source=chatgpt.com "newline - Git: how to renormalize line endings in all files in all ..."), [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics/configuring-git-to-handle-line-endings?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Configuring Git to handle line endings - GitHub Docs")).
    
    If your Git version is older and lacks `--renormalize`, use:
    
    ```bash
    git rm --cached -r .
    git reset --hard
    git add .
    git commit -m "Normalize all line endings"
    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Choosing Your `core.autocrlf` Setting

While `.gitattributes` overrides local Git config, it‚Äôs still a good idea to choose a safe global setting:

- **On Windows (your case)**: use `core.autocrlf=true`. This converts LF ‚Üí CRLF on checkout, and CRLF ‚Üí LF on commit‚Äîwhile `.gitattributes` ensures repo consistency.
    
- Alternatively, `core.autocrlf=input` also works well, converting CRLF ‚Üí LF on commit without forcing CRLF on checkout ([Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7156694/git-how-to-renormalize-line-endings-in-all-files-in-all-revisions?utm_source=chatgpt.com "newline - Git: how to renormalize line endings in all files in all ..."), [MyBlueLinux.com](https://www.mybluelinux.com/normalizing-line-endings-in-git-crlf-vs.-lf/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Normalizing Line Endings in Git: CRLF vs. LF - mybluelinux.com")).
    

You can set either with:

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf true
# or
git config --global core.autocrlf input
```

## üìã Summary Table

|Goal|Setting in `.gitattributes`|Recommended `core.autocrlf`|
|---|---|---|
|Ensure LF in repo, text detection enabled|`* text=auto eol=lf`|`true` or `input` (Windows/Unix)|
|Force LF for shell scripts|`*.sh text eol=lf`|Same as above|
|Force CRLF for batch scripts|`*.bat text eol=crlf`|Same as above|
|Preserve binary files untouched|`*.jpg, *.png, *.zip binary`|‚Äî|

## ‚úÖ How This Helps Your Hugo Project

- Eliminates the CRLF ‚Üí LF warnings you've been seeing.
    
- Ensures consistent line endings across environments.
    
- Allows Windows users to edit with CRLF (via their editor), while storing LF in the repo.
    
- Resolves phantom diffs caused by line-ending mismatches.
